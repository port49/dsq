== DESCRIPTION:

DSQ: Darn Simple Queuing

This is an internal DSL for Discrete Event Simulations.  Ruby 1.9 now has enough 
power under the hood that it can be useful to run a simulation in Ruby for the 
purpose of Operations Research; for example, we might wish to run a simulation 
of server performance in order to understand the benefits of adding components 
before going through the expense of installing them. In fact, the predecessor 
to DSQ was used for this purpose, analyzing log data to isolate a performance 
bottleneck on a high traffic web site in a multiple-mongrel configuration.

The code is heavily commented because the end user will often not be a programmer 
but rather will be primarily a statistician.

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

This is the first commit to begin upgrading the library to Ruby1.9. This is not yet 
alpha. Stuff is broke. Also just switched from RSpec to MiniTest.

== SYNOPSIS:

The simplest simulation will eventually look something like:

require 'dsq'

@simulation = Simulation.new do
  with_arrival_rate :exponential, :mean => 1.0
  with_service_rate :exponential, :mean => 0.9
end

@simulation.print_report
